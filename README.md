Basic gallery ladingpage
This website was created with semantic HTML tags and CSS style. 
The main idea was to create a site-responsive,  to display some of the photos taken by me. 
The site contains a principal header bar, which just displays the author name with a hover effect. 
the rest gallery is contained in the body with a set of images set on grid. 
Finally the footer contains personal information about the author
